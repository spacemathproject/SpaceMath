`git clone https://github.com/spacemathproject/SpaceMath.git`

or you can download zip file of this repository and after uncompress it.

Then, open in a terminal `dist` folder inside of `\SpaceMath\dist` and finally you can run 

`pip install spacemathpy-0.1.tar.gz`

Congratulations spacemathpy is installed.

You can use spacemathpy in scripts but is recomendable use jupyter notebook to ease each work, you will find 2HDM example in `\SpaceMath\Examples` folder

spacemathpy depends on numpy, pandas, sympy, and matplotlib to properly works, but when you install spacemathpy all of them are installed automatically.


Finally, if you decide uninstall spacemathpy you only need run the next command in any folder in your terminal
