# Python SpaceMath

This branch of SpaceMath project is an alternative implementation in python 3.*. Where python libraries as numpy, pandas, sympy and matplotlib are used to scan allowed parameter space in BSM models considering signals strength experimental values of Standard model Higgs decays.

You can try spacemathpy with binder only needs click in 

## Installation

Our package is a library for python 3 users that can be installed if you use git to clone this repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/spacemathproject/SpaceMath.git`

or you can download zip file of this repository and after uncompress it.

Then, open in a terminal `dist` folder inside of `\SpaceMath\dist` and finally you can run 

`pip install spacemathpy`

Congratulations spacemathpy is installed.

You can use spacemathpy in scripts but is recomendable use jupyter notebook to ease each work, you will find 2HDM example in `\SpaceMath\Examples` folder

spacemathpy depends on numpy, pandas, sympy, and matplotlib to properly works, but when you install spacemathpy all of them are installed automatically.
