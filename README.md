# SpaceMath package

> We present a Mathematica package, so-called SpaceMath, for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) parameter space searches which be agree with the most up-to-date experimental measurements. The physical observables implemented in SpaceMath are classified infive categories, namely, LHC Higgs boson data (LHC-HBD), Flavor-Violating Processes
(FVP), Oblique Parameters (OP), Unitarity (U) and Meson Physics (MP). Nevertheless, SpaceMath version 1.0 works only with LHC-HBD and with extended scalar sector models. Future versions will implement the observables previously mentioned.

> SpaceMath v1.0 is able tond allowed regions for free parameters of extension models by using LHC-HBD within a friendly interface and an intuitive environment in which users enter the couplings, set parameters and execute Mathematica in the traditional way. We present examples, step by step, in order to start new users in a fast and efficient way. To validate SpaceMath v1.0, we reproduce results reported in the literature.

Note that an error may appear due to the quotation marks (""), this can be resolved by deleting and then explicitly writing both quotation marks.

## First steps

> In order to introduce to new users, we display a collection of the basic commands of SpaceMath v1.0 for the Signal Strenghts with their application to the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Type-III (THDM-III). There are repeating arguments in all SpaceMath v1.0 commands, for this reason, let usrst list them in Table 1.

## Remote connection

> Requirements to remote connection:
> Mathematica version: 10.0, 11.0., 12.0.

- Steps to connect to server "Negrito".

> 1. Open a terminal and type:
> `ssh SpaceMath user@148.228.14.13 -Y`
> 2. Enter password: SpaceMath
> 3. Type `mathematicaX`, where X represents the Mathematica version.
> 4. Enjoy SpaceMath v1.0 package.

> If your `README` has a lot of info, section headers might be nice.
